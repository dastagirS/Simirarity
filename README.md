## About The Project

The machine learning model designed to find similar statements from multiple PDFs is a powerful tool that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract text data and identify patterns across documents.

The model is trained on a dataset of PDF documents and uses algorithms such as TF-IDF to extract text data from each PDF files. It takes PDF files as input and uses the previously defined functions to preprocess and vectorize the text data from each PDF file. Then, it calculates the cosine similarity score between each pair of sentences in the documents These techniques help to identify relationships between words and concepts, making it possible for the model to understand the meaning of sentences, rather than just individual words.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to compare new PDF documents and find similar statements. This process involves breaking down each document into smaller segments, such as sentences or paragraphs, and comparing these segments against one another. The model identifies the most similar segments by looking for patterns in the word choice, sentence structure, and overall meaning.
